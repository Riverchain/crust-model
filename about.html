                <p class="justify_long_text">Farhad Jazaei is
                    graduated
                    from
                    the Department of Civil
                    Engineering at Auburn
                    University. His research
                    efforts focus on understanding
                    the physical groundwater flow
                    groundwater flow and transport
                    processes in porous media.
                    <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                        His recent works deals with using the concepts of Mean Action Time theory to quantify the groundwater process time scales. Jazaei received M.Sc. in water resources management from Sharif University of Technology (Tehran-Iran) in 2009. He worked for three years in Environment & Water Research Center (EWRC) at Sharif university of Technology. In 2012, Jazaei began PhD at Auburn University.
                    Dr. Jazaei currently works with the Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering Research at the University of Memphis. In this world-renowned research institute for hydrological science, Dr. Jazaei is conducting research in one of Tennesseeâ€™s largest well fields to study and model the regionâ€™s groundwater flow. Based on concerns that water from the Mississippi River had begun leaking into the Memphis area aquifer via breaches in the confining layer, Dr. Jazaei has begun developing an analytical framework featuring MODFLOW-based groundwater modeling tools, stochastic analysis, and custom calibration approaches. In his work, he combines state-of-the-art parallel supercomputing technology and field data in order to identify likely breach locations and vulnerable zones in the confining layer between the Memphis aquifer and the shallow aquifer. </span></p>
